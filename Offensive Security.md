# 🧠 Offensive Security – Introduction (TryHackMe Pre Security)

> _"To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one."_

## 🔓 What is Offensive Security?

**Offensive Security** involves intentionally breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access. The goal is to **understand hacker tactics** in order to strengthen defenses.

---

## 💻 Practical Case: Hacking FakeBank

You are tasked with hacking the **FakeBank application** to steal money. You're provided with a user account to simulate being a regular user.

---

## 🕵️ Finding Hidden Functionality

One of the easiest ways to hack an application is by discovering **hidden features** or **secret URLs**. Sometimes, developers expose sensitive actions through URLs that aren't linked anywhere but still work if accessed directly.

---

## 🧰 Tool: `dirb`

### ❓ What is `dirb`?

`dirb` is a **brute-force tool** that scans a target website for hidden pages or directories. It uses a wordlist (a list of common page names) and tests them one by one to see which ones exist.

---

## 🖥️ Opening a Terminal

A **terminal** (also called the command line) allows users to interact with the computer by typing commands. Most hacking tools, including `dirb`, must be run through the terminal.

---

## 🚀 Running `dirb`

To scan the FakeBank site, use the following command:

```bash
dirb http://fakebank.thm
```

> Press **ENTER** to execute.

---

## 📄 Sample Output:

```bash
ubuntu@tryhackme:~/Desktop$ dirb http://fakebank.thm

## 🧠 How to Read the Output

- **URL_BASE**: The target site being scanned.
- **WORDLIST_FILES**: The dictionary of potential URLs used by `dirb`. Default: `/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt`.
- **FOUND**:
  - `bank-deposit`: A valid page (status code **200**).
  - `images`: A redirect (status code **301**).
  - The lines starting with a + sign are the results of the scan. In this case, dirb was able to find two URLs for you. Try opening them in the machine's browser! You might find something interesting.

📌 Tip: Try visiting the discovered URLs in your browser. They may reveal sensitive functionality.
